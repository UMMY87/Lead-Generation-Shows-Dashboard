## Overview
This repository contains data visualizations created from a cleaned dataset. The graphs highlight important trends and patterns, providing actionable insights into company statuses, locks, and contact methods.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Count of Company by Status**
   - **Purpose:** Analyze the distribution of companies across different statuses.
   - **Insights:**
     - Most companies are in the "Test" phase.
     - Moderate representation in the "HR" phase.
     - Least representation in "Phase 1."

### 2. **Count of Company by Lock**
   - **Purpose:** Display the number of locked versus unlocked companies.
   - **Insights:**
     - Majority of companies are not locked.
     - A small proportion of companies are locked.

### 3. **Count of Company by Contact Type**
   - **Purpose:** Show the frequency of various contact methods.
   - **Insights:**
     - "LinkedIn" is the most used contact method.
     - "LinkedIn Msg" and "LinkedIn Mail" are also popular.
     - Other methods ("Wellfound," "Mail," "Referral," etc.) are less frequently used.

## Data Source
The dataset includes information about companies, recruiters, statuses, contact methods, and locks. It has been cleaned to remove inconsistencies, standardize text, and address missing values.

## Interpreting the Visualizations
- **Bar Graphs:**
  - Each bar represents a category (e.g., "Status" or "ContactType"), with height indicating the count.
- **Colors:**
  - Blue bars represent counts for respective categories.

## Recommendations
- Focus on improving processes for the most frequent phases (e.g., "Test") to manage larger company volumes.
- Investigate why most companies remain unlocked and assess whether locking could improve outcomes.
- Optimize outreach through effective contact methods like "LinkedIn."
